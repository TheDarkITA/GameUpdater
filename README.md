# GameUpdater
A simple and lightweight game updater/patcher.
This repository includes two projects. The main [updater/launcher](GameUpdater) to ship with your game and a [manifest tool](ManifestTool) to easily and flexibly generate server manifest files.

As all releases are not self-contained, you and your user need to have .NET Core 3.1 installed. As all users should have installed this dependency anyways, you can ensure, that its available by adding it to your game installer.
